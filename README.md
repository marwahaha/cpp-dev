# Rep0

Was created 2.09.16. May have a great future. I really can't imagine what will be placed here. Really.

8.11.17 I suddenly realized that I have a repo. So, I've decided to reborn my activity on GitHub with initializing
this repo as C++ repo for practising in some projects. Firstly, it is project related to OpenGL+glut experience. Secondly, 
I haven't decided yet.
